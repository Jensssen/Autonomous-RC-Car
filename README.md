# Autonomous-RC-Car
This Repo is about an autonomous driving RC Car. The RC Car Hardware has been replaced with a Raspberry Pi. The CNN was made with TensorFlow (Keras). The CNN was trained in the AWS cloud. Due to the limited computational power of the RPi, the CNN is running on my computer and not on the RPi
